# AutoClean

Autoclean is a tool designed to quickly clean manga/comic pages from text, made for translation and localization enthusiasts who adapt works into their native language.

## Running The App

Put the manga/comic pages into the 'Input' folder.

Open main.py and select the language you expect to see on the pages you placed into the 'Input' folder (English is selected by default).

After that, run main.py and follow the instructions from the terminal.

## About AutoClean


AutoClean is far from perfect â€” EasyOCR sometimes fails to detect text, and some features that users might need may be missing. However, it still significantly reduces the time needed to clean pages, which is its main purpose.
I would be happy to hear your feedback, corrections, and suggestions for new features.
